**Sucks But Works**

# Steam-Mod-Downloader

Windows only

Change the app_id with the game's app_id

Requirements: Python ([Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and Steamcmd ([Download Here](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip), From [ValveSoftware's wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD))

Python libraries: 
```
pip install requests 
```
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Unzip Steamcmd and put the script in the same folder, make a mods.txt file and you'd be set. I recommend using something like TabCopy to get all the open tabs in Chromium based browsers [Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabcopy/micdllihgoppmejpecmkilggmaagfdmb) Or Export Tabs URLs in Firefox based browsers [Link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-and-titles/)


Usage:
Open all the mods you want in your browser
Copy the urls
Put them in the `mods.txt` file
Run `main.py`
